Testing and TDD
--------------

Testing:

- Checks to see if your code works
- Set objectives and metrics
- Know when your project is finished (Definition of Done)
- Code maintainability
- Increases robustness
- Reduces technical debt

Types of test:

Unit Test: Smallest test used for functions
Integration Test: Tests that the system can be properly used and does what it is supposed to do

TDD:

- Test --> Code --> Write --> Test etc.

In general: Write Test --> Do minimum to pass test --> Refractor --> <repeat>

This prevents you from expending effort doing things outside of your scope
